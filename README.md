🏥 Hospital Management System (SQL Project)
📘 Project Description

The Hospital Management System is a SQL-based database project designed to efficiently manage hospital operations, including doctors, patients, appointments, treatments, and billing. This project demonstrates the use of relational databases, normalization, foreign key relationships, and SQL queries for healthcare data analytics. It showcases how hospitals can store and analyze data for performance tracking, cost management, and operational insights.

🧩 Database Structure

The project contains five main tables:

Doctors – Stores details like doctor ID, name, specialty, and contact information.

Patients – Contains patient demographic details and contact info.

Appointments – Tracks appointment dates, assigned doctors, patients, and appointment status.

Treatments – Links to appointments, containing treatment descriptions and costs.

Bills – Records total billing amounts per patient along with billing dates.

⚙️ Functionalities

The project includes powerful SQL queries for managing and analyzing data:

Find doctors with the most completed appointments

Calculate total treatment cost per patient

Identify patients whose treatment costs exceed the average

Monthly billing summary and revenue trends

Doctors without appointments in the last 30 days

Average treatment cost per doctor

Patients with multiple appointments in the last 30 days

Average treatment cost by gender

Revenue generated by each department

Monthly patient admissions trend

💡 Key Highlights

Demonstrates data integrity with foreign keys.

Implements analytical SQL using subqueries, joins, aggregates, and window functions.

Suitable for learning data modeling, healthcare analytics, and SQL performance reporting.

Can be extended with triggers, stored procedures, or a front-end interface.
